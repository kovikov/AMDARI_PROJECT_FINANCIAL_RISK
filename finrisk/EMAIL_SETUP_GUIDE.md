## üîß **Step 2: Add Email Secrets to GitHub**

1. **Go to your GitHub repository:**
   - Visit: https://github.com/kovikov/AMDARI_PROJECT_FINANCIAL_RISK

2. **Add these secrets:**
   ```
   EMAIL_SMTP_SERVER = smtp.gmail.com

   EMAIL_USERNAME = rfondufe@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASSWORD = [Your 16-character app password from Step 1]
   NOTIFICATION_EMAIL = rfondufe@gmail.com
   ```

## üöÄ **Step 3: Test the Setup**
